Control Statements: using these statements we can control the flow of the program.

1. if else
2. switch case
3. loops
4. break, continue and goto

Two categories (control stmt):
control statements with branching: if-else, switch-case
control statements with looping: for, while and do-while.

1. If else 
program: 2 sets of instructions
> if this happens then execute first set of instructions
> if this doesn't happen then execute other set of instructions

program of even number: 2 printf statements (even, odd)
> if number is even then execute the first print stmt (even)
> if number is (not even / odd) then execute the second print stmt (odd)

Switch Case:
