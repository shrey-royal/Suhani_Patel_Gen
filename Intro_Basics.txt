Data Types: it specifies the type of data that can be stored in a variable. It also specifies the size of the memory that will be allocated to the variable.

> Basic Data Types: int (whole numbers), float(values with decimal points), char(only one alphabet), double (int + float)
> Derived Data Types: array, pointer, structure, union
> Enumeration Data Types: enum (array of constants)
> Void Data Types: void (nothing)

> Variable is an alias name for memory location. It is used to store data. Its value can be changed and it can be reused many times.

memory taken by each data type: 
int = 2 bytes
float = 4 bytes
char = 1 byte
double = 8 bytes

smallest unit of memory is bit (0 or 1)

bit = 0 or 1
//nibble = 4 bits
byte = 8 bits
//word = 2 bytes
//double word = 4 bytes
//quad word = 8 bytes
1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes
1 megabyte = 1024 kilobytes
1 gigabyte = 1024 megabytes
1 terabyte = 1024 gigabytes

Tokens : smallest unit of a program that is meaningful to the compiler. It can be a keyword, identifier, constant, string literal, special symbol, operator. It helps in forming a valid statement.

Keywords : words that have a predefined meaning in C. They cannot be used as variable names. They are also known as reserved words. They are all in lowercase.

Identifiers : names given to variables, functions, arrays, etc. They are user-defined. They are case sensitive. They can be a combination of letters, digits, and underscore. They cannot start with a digit. They cannot be a keyword.

Constants : fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program. They can be integer constants, real constants, character constants, string constants, and symbolic constants.
